# CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Email Client

This is a project for the **CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** course. The goal of the project is to design a front-end for an email client that communicates with a back-end API to send and receive emails.

## Features

- **Inbox**, **Sent**, and **Archived** mailboxes
- **Compose new email** functionality
- **View individual email** content
- **Archive and unarchive emails**
- **Reply to emails**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django framework
- JavaScript (for front-end functionality)
- HTML and CSS

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project3.git
cd project3
```
Setup Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations mail
python manage.py migrate
```
Run the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Usage

- **Sign Up**: Use the "Register" link to create an account with a fake email address and password.
- **Send Email**: Use the "Compose" page to send emails to other users.
- **View Emails**: View emails in your **Inbox**, **Sent**, and **Archived** mailboxes.
- **Archive Emails**: Archive/unarchive emails by marking them via the buttons in the mailbox.
- **Reply to Emails**: When viewing an email, you can reply to it, and the form will pre-fill with the recipientâ€™s email and email content.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /emails/<str:mailbox>**: Fetch emails from a specific mailbox (`inbox`, `sent`, `archive`).
- **GET /emails/<int:email_id>**: Fetch a specific email by its ID.
- **POST /emails**: Send a new email. Requires `recipients`, `subject`, and `body`.
- **PUT /emails/<int:email_id>**: Update email status, like marking as read/unread or archiving/unarchiving.
